In *problem 2* folder, there are two folders:
- *dual_test* - containing the *dual_test* solution library
- *node_modules* - the standard node modules folder to execute the test

To run the example test (test.js), simply run a command line interface inside the *problem 2* folder and type:
> npm run test

Or just run the *run.bat* file provided in the solution.

There are several *.txt* files provided in this solution:
- *File1.txt*: The first input file containing 1000 API requests
- *File2.txt*: The second input file containing 1000 API requests
- *File3.txt*: Another input file, this time containing just 5 API requests (for testing purposes)
- *File4.txt*: Another input file, this time containing just 5 API requests (for testing purposes)
- *report.txt*: A report file generated by the solution containing *equals* and *not equals* statements

By default, the *test.js* script is set to take *File1.txt* and *File2.txt* as inputs. 
To change the input, change the parameter of dualTest function in *test.js*, following this format:

> dualTest('<*input file 1*>', '<*input file 2.extension*'>)

For example:

> dualTest('File3.txt', 'File4.txt')

changed the input files from *File1.txt* and *File2.txt* to *File3.txt* and *File4.txt*
